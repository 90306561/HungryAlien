# HungryAlien

This was my first independent app. This app randomly spawns different food items with different velocities "flying" across the screen. Your objective is then to swipe the food into the UFO to "feed" the alien. Each good item has different healthy and happy values, changing how happy and healthy the alien is. My main struggle with this app was to figure out how to make the sprites get dragged, after going through a tutorial, I then figured it out.
